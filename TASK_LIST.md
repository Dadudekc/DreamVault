  - **Verification**: Full training pipeline test passes, all components integrate correctly
- [ ] **Step 2**: Add tests for conversation ingestion and processing
  - Test conversation data loading and preprocessing
  - Test conversation filtering and validation
  - Test conversation-to-training-data conversion
  - **Verification**: Conversation processing tests pass, edge cases handled gracefully
- [ ] **Step 3**: Test model deployment and API endpoints
  - Test model serialization and loading
  - Test API endpoint functionality and error handling
  - Test model serving performance and scalability
  - **Verification**: Deployment tests pass, API endpoints respond correctly under load

### Task 4: Performance Optimization (Ready to Start)
- [ ] **Step 1**: Add performance benchmarks for critical operations
  - Benchmark database operations and query performance
  - Benchmark AI model training and inference times
  - Benchmark file I/O and data processing operations
